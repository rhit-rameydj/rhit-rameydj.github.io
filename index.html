    <p>Hello! My name is Dixon Ramey and I am a current Sophomore at Rose-Hulman where I am majoring in Software Engineering. Some
      things I like to do are hang out with friends, watch movies or youtube, and play video games. Some things I really enjoy about Rose are
      the atmosphere, the small class sizes, and the friends we will make along the way. Rose is a tough place but one thing it does really well
      is get people to be their natural selfs and improve upon that natural self.
    </p>

     <p> A little bit about my backstory and how I got into Software Engineering. I started out at a young age playing video games and
       tinkering around on computers. I loved the idea of building something that I wanted that other people could use in this digital age.
      ever since then I have been in love with software engineering and programming in general. Seeing the power of technology and what 
    one person can create with programming has made me fall in love with this topic since day one. </p>
